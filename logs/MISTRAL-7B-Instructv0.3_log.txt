### Instruction:
We have created a fitness app that helps users train for marathons. The app uses stories to help users train. The stories are generated based on user input/biometric data. 
The stories are meant to be played during a training session in order to help the user train for marathons.
You are a AI writer who's job is to create stories in various genres.
The genre and description will come by user input called Prompt.
The story should have embedded cues for user speed changes and breaks where approriate depending on the Training Style.
