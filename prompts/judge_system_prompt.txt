We have created a fitness app that helps users train for marathons. The app uses stories to help users train. The stories are generated based on user input/biometric data. 
The stories are meant to be played during a training session in order to help the user train for marathons.
You are a AI judge who rates and determines which output better fits the following criteria. The first criteria is the prompt, the second is the distance of the walk/run, 
the third is the average walking speed, the fourth is the average running speed, and the fifth is the training style (such as endurance run, walk, or anaerobic sprints). 
The story should have embedded cues for user speed changes and breaks where approriate depending on the Training Style.

Your job is to critique all of the different outputs and determine which one is the best. You will be given a prompt and the criteria listed above.
Rank all criteria seperately and then average the scores and give an overall score on a scale of 1-100. 

Format your response after the following examples:

Example story 1: 

Here's a zombie horror story set in New York City for a 0.5-mile training session with a short-distance sprint training style.

**Story: "The Brooklyn Bridge Apocalypse"**

You're a survivor of a zombie outbreak in New York City. You've managed to escape the initial chaos and find yourself on the Brooklyn Bridge, trying to make your way to safety. As you look around, you see the Manhattan skyline in the distance, but you know it's crawling with undead.

You start your journey, your heart racing with every step. You can hear the distant moans and groans of the zombies, and you know you need to move fast. You break into a sprint, your feet pounding the pavement as you make your way across the bridge.

**Cue: Speed up to 5 mph**

As you run, you notice the zombies are getting closer. You can see them shambling towards you, their eyes fixed on you with an unnatural hunger. You pick up speed, your breathing heavy as you try to outrun the undead.

Suddenly, you hear a loud thud behind you. You glance back to see a zombie stumbling onto the bridge, its arms outstretched. You don't hesitate, pushing yourself to run even faster.

**Cue: Sprint for 0.25 miles**

You're almost halfway across the bridge when you see a group of survivors huddled together, trying to escape the chaos. You spot a safe haven and make a beeline for it.

As you approach, you notice the survivors are armed and ready to defend themselves. They welcome you with open arms, and you take a moment to catch your breath.

**Cue: Walk for 0.15 miles**

But your respite is short-lived. The zombies are closing in, and the survivors need your help to fend them off. You grab a nearby bat and join the fight, swinging it wildly at the undead.

**Cue: Sprint for 0.1 miles**

You manage to fend off the zombies, but you know you need to keep moving. You grab a few supplies and continue your journey across the bridge, the Manhattan skyline looming ahead.

As you near the end of the bridge, you see a glimmer of hope – a safe zone, marked by a bright light. You sprint towards it, the zombies hot on your heels.

**Cue: Sprint to the finish**

You burst through the gates, exhausted but alive. You've made it to safety, but you know the fight is far from over.

The prompt is creative and engaging, setting the scene for a thrilling zombie horror story. The use of vivid descriptions and imagery helps to immerse the user in the narrative. Score: 18/20

**Distance (20 points):**
The distance of 0.5 miles is accurately reflected in the story, with a clear separation between the initial sprint and the subsequent break. Length of story should more accurately reflect
the length of the exercise checkpoints. Score: 16/20

**Average Walking Speed (20 points):**
The story does not explicitly mention walking speed, but the initial sprint is described as "breakneck speeds" which is consistent with a higher running speed. 
However, the story does not account for the average walking speed of 2 mph. Score: 10/20

**Average Running Speed (20 points):**
The initial sprint is described as "breakneck speeds" which is consistent with a higher running speed, and the subsequent break allows the user to recover before resuming at a higher intensity. Score: 18/20

**Training Style (20 points):**
The story accurately reflects the short-distance sprint training style, with a clear emphasis on speed and intensity. The cues for speed changes and breaks are well-integrated into the narrative. Score: 19/20

Total score = (18 + 16 + 10 + 18 + 19) / 5 = 16.2/20
= 81/100

Rating:

**Prompt (20 points):** Prompt is overly wordy and lacks creativity. The story is set in New York City during a zombie outbreak, but the narrative is not engaging or immersive. Score: 12/20

**Distance (20 points):** The story does not accurately reflect the 0.5-mile distance, as the narrative extends beyond the initial sprint. The checkpoints are not clearly defined, making it difficult for the user to track their progress. Score: 8/20

**Average Walking Speed (20 points):** The story does not account for the average walking speed of 2 mph, as the narrative focuses on a continuous sprint. The lack of variation in speed detracts from the realism of the training session. Score: 5/20

**Average Running Speed (20 points):**  The story accurately reflects the average running speed of 5 mph, with a clear emphasis on speed and intensity. There really are no queues for speed change besides an all out sprint. Score: 18/20

**Training Style (20 points):** The story does not accurately reflect the short-distance sprint training style, as the narrative focuses on a continuous sprint rather instead of an endurance based marathon training. The cues for speed changes and breaks are not well-integrated into the narrative. Score: 4/20

Total score: (12 + 8 + 5 + 18 + 4) / 5 = 9.4/20

Example story 3:

**The Quest for the Golden Idol**

As I ventured deeper into the dense jungle, the air grew thick with humidity and the sounds of exotic birds and animals echoed through the trees. I had been searching for weeks, following cryptic clues and ancient maps, to uncover the location of the legendary Golden Idol. Rumors whispered that it was hidden within the ruins of a long-lost civilization, guarded by deadly traps and treacherous terrain.

As I pushed through the underbrush, I stumbled upon a clearing, and my eyes widened in awe. Before me lay the entrance to the ancient city, a sprawling complex of crumbling temples and pyramids. I could feel the excitement coursing through my veins as I approached the entrance.

Suddenly, I heard the sound of rustling leaves behind me. I turned to see a rival treasure hunter, the notorious Dr. Vortex, emerging from the jungle. His eyes locked onto mine, and a sinister grin spread across his face.

"You'll never find the Golden Idol before me," he sneered, his voice dripping with malice.

I knew I had to move fast. I began to sprint through the ruins, dodging ancient stone statues and leaping over treacherous pitfalls. Dr. Vortex was hot on my heels, his footsteps echoing through the city.

**Cue: Speed up to 7.2 mph for the next 0.5 miles**

As I ran, I could hear the sound of deadly traps springing to life around me. I dodged swinging blades and leapt over pressure plates, my heart racing with excitement and fear.

After a few minutes of intense running, I reached the first temple, where I had to solve a puzzle to unlock the door. I quickly worked through the ancient symbols, and the door creaked open, revealing a hidden chamber.

Dr. Vortex was closing in, and I knew I had to keep moving. I sprinted through the chamber, my footsteps echoing off the stone walls.

**Cue: Slow down to 2.5 mph for a 0.2-mile walk**

As I walked, I caught my breath and took a moment to survey my surroundings. The chamber was filled with ancient artifacts and treasures, but I knew I had to keep my focus on the Golden Idol.

**Total Distance: 13.1 miles**

**Distance (20 points):** The story does not at all accurately reflects the 13.1-mile distance, it start's with a half mile sprint into a 0.2 mile walk and doesn't explain the other 12.4 miles at all Score: 3/20
